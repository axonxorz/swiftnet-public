        "Experiencing frequent issues with Starlink in Alberta or Saskatchewan?",
      answer:
        'If you\'re a Starlink customer in Alberta or Saskatchewan, you might frequently encounter some of these common error messages:\n\n1. **"Non-Starlink wifi router"**: This error message appears when the Starlink app shows a disconnected status. Users report this error even when they are only using the Starlink wifi router, leading to confusion and frustration.\n\n2. **"Starlink Disconnected"**: This message means the app cannot reach the dish. Users are advised to ensure the plug going into the dish is pushed all the way in. This can be a frequent issue, disrupting your internet connection when you need it the most.\n\n3. **"Starlink is unable to reach the dish"**: Similar to the above, this message indicates that the Starlink app is unable to communicate with the dish. Users are advised to ensure that the Starlink device is properly plugged in. This can be a recurring problem, causing unnecessary stress and inconvenience.\n\n4. **"Network Issue"**: This error message is often associated with a bad cable between the Starlink router and dish. Users report frequent outages due to this issue, leading to a lack of reliable internet service.\n\n5. **"Something went wrong"**: This error message appears when users are trying to place an order. It seems to be associated with issues related to the postal code not matching the shipping address, causing delays and complications with your service.\n\n6. **"Location error"**: This error message appears when setting up the Starlink kit. It indicates that the Starlink device is in the wrong location, leading to setup difficulties and potential delays in getting your internet service up and running.\n\n7. **"dns_probe_started errors"**: This error message appears when there are issues with the DNS probe. Users report this error after using Starlink for a few months, indicating a lack of long-term reliability.\n\n8. **"What is \'Network issue\'?"**: This error message appears when there are issues with the network setup. Users report this error when using additional devices like a TP-Link Powerline or TP-Link WiFi interface with their Starlink router, leading to complex and frustrating network problems.\n\nMoreover, Starlink can frequently experience disruptions during heavy rain or snow. This is due to a phenomenon known as "rain fade," which can affect all satellite communications. Rain or snow can absorb or scatter the radio waves that satellites use to communicate, leading to a weaker signal or a complete loss of signal.\n\nIn contrast, Swift-Net.ca, a local Wireless Internet Service Provider (WISP) in Alberta and Saskatchewan, offers a more reliable and consistent service. We don\'t throttle data after a certain point, and we don\'t charge extra for high data users. Our service is designed to withstand the unique weather and environmental conditions of Alberta and Saskatchewan, ensuring you stay connected even during heavy rain or snow.\n\nOur local support team is always ready to assist you, providing timely and effective solutions to keep your online activities running smoothly.

      title: "Is Rogers offline?",
      answer:
        "If you're searching \"Is Rogers offline?\" because you're experiencing an outage, you're not alone.
